Brief Description:
	Construct a traffic monitoring signal using a microprocessor and counters. The counter counts the number of vehicles that passed and would automatically change the color of the light to yellow then to green if it has reached the number of vehicles programmed. There will be a remote control provided to the emergency responders such as ambulances, fire trucks and the like, in order for them to pass by without any delay.
